## Overview

ShowUI-π is a 450M flow-based vision-language-action model that treats GUI actions as continuous trajectories, generating smooth clicks and drags directly from screen observations. It unifies discrete and continuous actions, enabling precise drawing, rotation, sorting, and captcha solving without tokenized coordinates.
